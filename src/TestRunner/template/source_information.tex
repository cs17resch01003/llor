\section{Source Code Information}
\figref{code_lines} shows the size of the programs in terms of lines of code. The average number of lines of code for the test suite is @@lines_avg@@, and the median is @@lines_med@@. @@lines_100@@ more than $100$ lines of code, and @@lines_50@@ more than $50$ lines of code.

\input{figures/lines_insts}

The instrumentation component of \tool works with LLVM IR and not on the source code. A line of source code could result in zero (e.g., code comments) or more LLVM IR instructions. LLVM IR was generated for @@insts_cnt@@. @@insts_fail@@ did not reach the instrumentation stage of \tool since the compiler could not generate LLVM IR for them. \figref{llvm_insts} shows the size of the programs in terms of LLVM IR instructions. The average number of LLVM IR instructions for the test suite is @@insts_avg@@, and the median is @@inst_med@@.

\input{figures/barriers}

The repair step of \tool depends on the number of barrier variables that have been introduced during instrumentation. \figref{barrier_variables} shows the number of barrier variables introduced in the instrumentation stage of \tool. The average number of barrier variables for the test suite is @@bars_avg@@, and the median is @@bars_med@@.
