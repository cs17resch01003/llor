\section{Benchmark Summary}
A total of @@total@@ considered for these experiments. This benchmark set consists of @@cplusplus@@ C/C++ and @@fortran@@ Fortran programs. Some of these benchmarks have one source file per benchmark, and the remaining have multiple source files per benchmark. \tableref{benchmark_summary} summarizes the categorization of the kernels. For benchmarks that have a single source file, the experiments were performed with a timeout of @@sftimeout@@ for each benchmark. For benchmarks that have multiple source files, the experiments were performed with a timeout of @@mfftimeout@@ for each source file and an overall timeout of @@mftimeout@@ for the benchmark. Each benchmark has been executed @@runs@@, and the average time is taken into consideration. The source data used to generate this report is available in the \TT{summary.csv} file.

This benchmark set provided with the artifacts consists of programs from the DataRaceBench~\cite{liao2017dataracebench} test suite, Exascale~\cite{exascale} project, Rodinia~\cite{che2009rodinia} test suite, and Parallel Research Kernels~\cite{parres}, along with additional benchmarks introduced while developing \tool.
